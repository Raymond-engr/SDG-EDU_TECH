Below is a detailed plan outlining the backend architecture, implementation steps, and a mini product requirements document (PRD) for a feature-rich research portal. This plan covers the major modules, database models, API endpoints, and integration points needed to build a backend for the described site.


---

1. Functional Overview

Main Feature Sections

Content Display:

A main public-facing section that displays research articles.

Three subsections for categorization: Research, Innovation, and Development.

Each article belongs to one of these subsections.


Analytics:

Track and record view counts for each research article.


Comments:

Allow anonymous users to leave comments on any article.

Provide admin functionality to moderate (delete) comments.



Admin Dashboard Features

User Invitations:

Ability for admin to send an invite link via email to potential lecturer/researcher users.

The invite link leads to a form that collects:

Name

Profile picture (upload)

Faculty/Department

Title (e.g., Lecturer, Professor, Dr, Engr)


On submission, a user profile is created but without any special access (i.e., they cannot sign in).


Content Management:

Admin can upload research articles manually:

Select a researcher profile to assign the article.

Upload related images (stored locally or in a cloud bucket).

Input article text/content.


When an article is published, it becomes visible on the public site.


Email Notifications:

On article publication, the system automatically sends email notifications to all subscribers who signed up to receive updates from that particular researcher.

2. Technical Architecture

Backend Framework & Language

Suggested Stack:

A robust framework like Node.js (Express/Koa) or Python (Django/Flask).

Use RESTful API design for communication between the frontend and backend.



Database

Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL) is recommended for structured data, including:

Users: Stores lecturer/researcher profiles.

Research Articles: Includes fields for title, content, images, category (Research/Innovation/Development), publication date, and view count.

Comments: Stores comment text, article reference, and timestamp.

Invitations: Tracks pending invites and their statuses.

Subscriptions: Maps emails to researcher profiles for notifications.



Storage & File Handling

Local File Storage or Cloud Storage:

For handling image uploads associated with articles or user profiles.

Integration with a service like AWS S3 if scalability is a concern.



Email Service Integration

Transactional Email Service:

Integrate with an SMTP server or services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES for sending invitation emails and publication notifications.



Analytics

View Tracking:

Middleware or API endpoints that increment a view counter each time an article is accessed.

Optionally use a caching layer (e.g., Redis) for real-time counting and then periodic database sync.



Authentication & Authorization

Admin Authentication:

Secure login (possibly using JWTs or session-based authentication) for accessing the admin dashboard.


Public Access:

No authentication required for reading research articles or posting comments.

3. Database Schema Outline

Example Models

User (Researcher Profile)

id: Primary key

name

profile_picture: URL/path to uploaded image

faculty

title

created_at

Note: No login credentials are stored for these profiles as they are created via invitation.


Invitation

id: Primary key

email: Email address the invitation was sent to

invite_token: Unique token for the registration link

status: Pending, Accepted, Expired

sent_at


ResearchArticle

id: Primary key

title

content

category: Enum (Research, Innovation, Development)

author_id: Foreign key to User

image_paths: Array or relation to an Images table

published_at

view_count


Comment

id: Primary key

article_id: Foreign key to ResearchArticle

text

posted_at

Optionally: IP address or minimal metadata for moderation purposes


Subscription

id: Primary key

email: Subscriber’s email

researcher_id: Foreign key to User (indicating which researcher they want notifications from)

subscribed_at




---

4. API Endpoints & Services

Public Endpoints

GET /articles

Retrieve list of articles (with filtering by category).


GET /articles/:id

Retrieve a specific article, and increment view count.


POST /articles/:id/comments

Allow anonymous posting of comments.



Admin Endpoints

POST /admin/invite

Input: Email address and optionally researcher details.

Process: Generate an invite token and send the registration link.


POST /admin/register-invite

Endpoint for lecturers/researchers to fill out and complete their profile using the token.


POST /admin/articles

Create a new research article.

Process: Accept article content, images (upload), and associate with a researcher.


PUT /admin/articles/:id

Update an article (e.g., add images, update content).


DELETE /admin/comments/:id

Remove inappropriate comments.



Notification & Analytics Services

Notification Service:

Triggered after publishing an article.

Fetch list of subscribers for the specific researcher and dispatch emails.


View Tracking Service:

Middleware on article retrieval endpoints to update and store view counts (possibly using caching for efficiency).

5. Implementation Steps

Step 1: Requirements & Design Specification

Finalize the PRD detailing all functional and non-functional requirements.

Create wireframes/mockups for the admin dashboard and public view.

Define API contracts and data models.


Step 2: Environment Setup & Framework Selection

Set up your development environment.

Choose the backend framework and initialize the project repository.

Configure a relational database and any additional caching (Redis, if needed).


Step 3: Database Schema & ORM Configuration

Design and create the database schema (tables for Users, Invitations, Articles, Comments, Subscriptions).

Use an ORM (e.g., Sequelize for Node.js, or Django ORM for Python) to model these relationships.


Step 4: Build Core API Endpoints

Public API:

Develop endpoints to serve articles and handle view counts.

Build the comment submission endpoint with basic input validation.


Admin API:

Develop endpoints for inviting users, registering them via token, and content management (CRUD for articles).



Step 5: File Upload and Storage Integration

Implement image/file upload functionality.

Configure file storage (local disk or integrate with a cloud storage solution).


Step 6: Email Integration

Integrate with an email service.

Create email templates for the invitation and notification emails.

Implement the logic to send notifications on article publication.


Step 7: Analytics & Caching Layer

Implement view tracking middleware.

Optionally integrate a caching solution (e.g., Redis) to handle high traffic and aggregate view counts before writing to the database.


Step 8: Admin Dashboard Integration

Develop a custom admin dashboard (this may be a separate frontend) that interacts with the admin endpoints.

Ensure secure authentication and role-based access control.


Step 9: Testing & QA

Write unit and integration tests for API endpoints.

Conduct end-to-end testing, including file uploads, email sending, and view count tracking.

Test edge cases (e.g., expired invitation tokens, invalid input on comments).


Step 10: Deployment & Monitoring

Set up deployment pipelines (CI/CD) and deploy the backend to a production environment.

Configure logging, error reporting, and monitoring tools to track performance and issues.

Plan for scalability and future enhancements.

6. Additional Considerations

Security:

Sanitize all user inputs (comments, form submissions) to prevent injection attacks.

Secure file uploads by verifying file types and sizes.


Rate Limiting:

Implement rate limiting for public endpoints to prevent abuse (especially on comment submission and view counting).


Scalability:

Design the system to support scaling horizontally (especially the API endpoints and caching layers).


Extensibility:

Design APIs to be extensible so that future features (e.g., detailed analytics dashboards, user account features) can be added with minimal disruption.

This comprehensive plan should serve as a solid foundation to develop a backend architecture for a research portal similar to UCT’s feature page while incorporating your custom requirements.
